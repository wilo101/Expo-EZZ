## 2026-02-28 - Optimize React Native List Item Re-renders
**Learning:** List item components (e.g., `ProductCard`) rendered inside `FlatList` must be wrapped in `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders. When optimizing, also remove manual `Image.prefetch` if using `expo-image` (which handles caching automatically) and eliminate synchronous `console.log` statements in the render cycle or gesture handlers to prevent frame drops.
**Action:** When creating or modifying components for `FlatList`, default to using `React.memo`. Define the component as a constant first (`const Component = ...`) and then export the memoized version (`export const ComponentName = memo(Component)`) to preserve the name in React DevTools. Avoid manual prefetching with `expo-image` and clean up console logs in hot paths.
